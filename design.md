# Ideas 

About me could be a parallax scroll through of einstein/john wooden quotes and end on things i enjoy. 

Movie page should have discuss favorite movie as well as star wars/indiana jones then move onto the list

I liked the idea of header photos like Gareth Lewis, collage of movies for example on movie page
